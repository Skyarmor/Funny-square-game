# Funny-square-game-1-
The original funny square game!!! the most sexy game in the world!! (real)


This is written in python, the graphics library is a very horrible, yet easy to use library called "cmu graphics". I no longer use this library for game development for obvoious reasons. However, it is pretty simple to install. 

INSTALLATION STEPS:

Make sure you have pip installed. If you do not have pip installed, you won't be able to install modules into python, which are a major requirement for basically every python game out there.

Open your CMD command prompt as administrator, and copy this command into it:

pip install cmu-graphics

This command will simply install the module "cmu-graphics". Thanks for reading this and playing it. It is my first sort of "real" game I have developed and even though I see how low quality it is now, I personally am really impressed with my abilities. Developing this was a major learning experience for me as it showed me the basics of game development, and how I should do it. I have since moved onto further projects, and I will never work on or update this game EVER again. You have full rights to mod it. The game is completely open source and modding it and distributing mods is completely allowed by anyone. Thank you for reading this sort of long description and I hope that you play some of my other games too!
